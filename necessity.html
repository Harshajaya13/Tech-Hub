                    <p>
                        Third-party institutes and course sellers invest in your <strong>Fear</strong>. They make you feel inadequate so you buy their ₹10,000 course. 
                        <strong>Say No.</strong> If you have the will, the internet has the resources for free. Confidence is free; don't pay for it.
